SuckerPunchCodingTest
=====================

# Test Plan
The purpose of this readme is to explain some test scenarios and strategy
for the SuckerPunchCoding.
1. Functional Requirements
*  System should be able to create Queue | R1
*  System should be able to destroy Queue | R2
*  System should be able to enque | R3
*  System should be able to dequeue | R4
*  System should be able to support until 2047 bytes in queues | R5
*  System should support 15 queues with an average of 80 or so bytes in each queue | R6

The following test cases will be covered
1. Queue/Dequeue
    * Normal values like: 1, 2, 3
    * Bigger values like: 20, 40, 60
    * Zero values
    * Negative values
2. OutOfMemory * Illegal operation
    * System should be able to handle when the memory is almost full.
    * System should not be able to handle when memory is full for cases like:
      * uses no more than 2048 bytes to implement all byte queues, and
      * must support 15 queues with an average of 80 or so bytes in each queue.

# Test Framework
1. Selected Google Test Framework
Reasons:
* Is portable: it doesnâ€™t require exceptions or RTTI; it works around various bugs in various compilers and environments.
* Nonfatal assertions, for example "EXPECT", are very useful when you want to report many failures.
* Assertions are easy to handle.
* Good Documentation.
* Easy to handle Death Test.

# Configuration
* Install Google test (GNU/Linux - Debian based)
1. Install gtest development package
```
$ sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev
```
2. Install cmake
```
$ sudo apt-get install cmake
```
3. Compile CMakeLists
```
$ cd /usr/src/gtest
$ sudo cmake CMakeLists.txt
$ sudo make
# copy or symlink "libgtest.a" and "libgtest_main.a: to your /usr/lib folder
$ sudo cp lib/*.a /usr/lib
```
# Run the tests
* Being in `test` directory and type the following commands
```
$ cmake CMakeLists.txt
$ make
$ ./runTests
Test report, just add the following flag
$ ./runTests --gtest_output=xml
